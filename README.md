# Bison Voyageur - front-end

##Â Context

Several years ago I traveled for a year and wrote a blog about it.  
At the time I was not a web developer, so I used Wordpress... It's good, but.. heavy!
And now I know what I'm doing and want to experiment more!
That's why I'm rebuilding it from scratch.

## Technology

I chose to use SvelteKit for the frontend.  
Why Svelte? because it's very comfortable to use! Very enjoyable coding experience! Also because I believe Svelte is a very promising project that will soon have a big share in the frontend framework market!
For the backend, I coded a small nodeJS app that sends requests to an existing SQLite database. I may end up to publish it on GitHub some day, but I don't feel the need so far.
